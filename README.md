# Audio Track Fusion and Phase Inversion Project

This project combines audio tracks to create a unique auditory experience. It allows you to merge an original stereo music track with two phase-inverted audio tracks, resulting in a distinctive audio composition.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the process of combining audio tracks, inverting the phase of one track, and then fusing them together. The result is a stereo audio composition with unique sound characteristics.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the C++ code using the provided audio files.
3. Experiment with different audio tracks and configurations to explore the effects of phase inversion and audio fusion.

## Prerequisites

- C++ development environment
- LibSndfile library for audio file handling
- PortAudio library for audio playback (if necessary)
- Audio files for the original music track and the phase-inverted tracks

## Usage

Modify the code and audio files as needed to achieve the desired audio fusion results. You can adjust the audio files and the combination process to experiment with different soundscapes.
